        The authors of this paper survey 12 US utilities to create a comparison between ancillary services among utilities. The authors used the recent \gls{ferc} proposed rule that defined six ancillary services: "scheduling and dispatch, load following, systems protection, energy imbalance, loss compensation, and reactive power/voltage control". The estimated ancillary service costs were a combination of embedded-costs and market clearing prices. \\
        
        This paper is very old compared to most of the other research I have found, but I think it is vital to understand the value of grid services if you want to monetize distributed energy resources. I will defiantly cite this in my article.
