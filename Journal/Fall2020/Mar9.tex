\begin{entry}{Initial Script}{March 9, 2021}
    \objective
    Test
    Start a python script that connects me to GridAPPS. Start playing around with queries.

    \outline

    Today's tasks were:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Get a python file up and running
            \item Connect to a model via python api
            \item Get the model mrid
            \item Do some sort of live query
        \end{itemize}

    \procedures

        Getting the script set up was routine. PyCharm is a lot more efficient than Spyder.
        I used a combination of the hackathon and instructions to generate the required code.

    \parameters

    N/A

    \observations

        Everything worked as expected. The visualization id was easy to get from a query. The
        blazegraph part was harder. See data.

    \data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Code is on GitHub.
        \item sim id: '357545598'
        \item 13 node feeder MRID: '_49AD8E07-3BF9-A4E2-CB8F-C3722F837B62'
    \end{itemize}




    \results

    Done.
