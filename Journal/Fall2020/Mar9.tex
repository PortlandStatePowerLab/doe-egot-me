\begin{entry}{Initial Script}{March 9, 2021}
    \objective
    Start a python script that connects me to GridAPPS. Start playing around with queries.

    \outline

    Today's tasks were:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Get a python file up and running
            \item Connect to a model via python api
            \item Get the model mrid
            \item Do some sort of live query
        \end{itemize}

    \procedures

        Getting the script set up was routine. PyCharm is a lot more efficient than Spyder.
        I used a combination of the hackathon and instructions to generate the required code.

    \parameters

    N/A

    \observations

        Everything worked as expected. The visualization id was easy to get from a query. The
        blazegraph part was harder. See data.

        I had a hard time with the Pull Request. Make a new branch first locally, make changes, commit, push to remote,
        then make the pull request. Update main locally, and delete branches.

        Some other issues and errors with the latex compiler. Turned off syncTex (which seems unnecessary to begin with,
        it just allows you to go directly to a pdf line from the code??) Needed another run command too, see options.

    \data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Code is on GitHub.
        \item sim id: '357545598'
        \item 13 node feeder MRID: '\textunderscore49AD8E07-3BF9-A4E2-CB8F-C3722F837B62'
    \end{itemize}




    \results

    Done.
