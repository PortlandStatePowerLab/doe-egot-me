\begin{entry}{EdmCore and Callback Classes: step 1}{Aug 21, 2021}
    \objective 
    
    Get started on EDMCore. See if I can get a simulation running.

    \outline

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Retrieve useful code from the Log Test.
        \item Start filling in the methods.
        \item Add startup calls to the program's run routine.

    \end{itemize}

    \procedures
    
    Code them.

    \parameters
    
    N/A

    \observations
    
    Got it done. Everything worked smoothly. The MC is now able to initiate and run simulations from GridAPPS-D.
    It has the old issue where nothing stops, I'll have to hard code that in.
    Bigger issue: I started working with callback classes. The commands don't work. The sim runs, but nothing happens.
    The callbacks aren't called when expected. Need to talk to PNNL about this.

    \data
    
    All recorded data, or where it can be found.
    
    \results
    
    EDMCore is a bit more done than I was expecting, since I was able to do things like add config.txt.
    Callbacks are the next thing to tackle. I knew they'd be a problem, so this is fine. Consult with PNNL. Will report
    back in next entry.
