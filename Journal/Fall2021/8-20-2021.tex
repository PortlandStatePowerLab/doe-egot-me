\begin{entry}{Reorganization and Journal Update}{August 20, 2021}
    \objective 
    
    % What do you want to do?
    I need to establish mise en place for development of the ME.
    \outline
    
    %What steps are required?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reorganize my directory, put old files in an Outdated folder.
        \item Restart this journal.
        \item Update github README.md.
        \item Create ModelController.py
    \end{itemize}
    
    \procedures
    
    Should all be self explanatory.

    \parameters
    
    The point is to get ready to work without fumbling over old files or struggling to get my journal in order. The
    directory reorganization is pretty straight forward. Restarting this journal starts with this entry, but also
    organizing my journal update plan (which should be: update the journal every time you push, not commit.) I've
    already created ModelController.py and added the class outline to it in class form; most of the daily work from here
    on out will be adding classes and methods one by one, along with testing.

    The README needs refactored, and some documentation should be made public. I need to decide what gets links and
    what, if anything, gets added to the repository directly.
    
    \observations
    
    I did it.
    Needs more documentation, but I'll figure out the most useable way of handling that in the future.
    
    \data
    
    N/A

    \results
    
    I'm done enough to be ready to move on with programming next week.

%    Determine the cause of the CMake error while running the dockerfile and modify file to get it to successfully build.

%    \begin{itemize}

%        \item If I get the error track down its cause and modify dockerfile to fix.
%        \item Repeat until all builds are successful.
